### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am [Rakib](https://rakibul.dev), currently working at MBM Group, developping [ERP](http://erp.aql-bd.com) using Laravel, Vue.js and MysQl.

ðŸŒ± In my free time, I like to develop open source projects. Some of them are -

- [Number to Bangla](https://github.com/RakibDevs/number-to-bangla) - Laravel package to convert any English number to Bangla. Also available in [@WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/number-to-bangla/)
- [Open Weather Map](https://github.com/RakibDevs/openweather-laravel-api) - Laravel package for connecting Open Weather Map API.

ðŸŒ± Also working on a new package [Laravel Query Extra](https://github.com/RakibDevs/laravel-query-extra), which handle complex queries in Laravel.
